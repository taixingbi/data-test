Plastic plants need love, too. They don’t however, need water. There’s something great about buying a plant, taking care of it and actually having it survive for more than a week or two. I put so much love into this plant! I washed its leaves. Tried my hardest to keep it looking its best, and it’s completely plastic! I feel like these last two years have been a lie.
