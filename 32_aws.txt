plastic plants and he'd love to. they don't however, any water. there is something great about buying a plan, taking care of it and actually having it survived more than a week or two. i put so much love into this plant. i washed this leaves, tried my heart is to keep it looking its best, and it's completely plastic. i feel i like these two years have been a lie.
