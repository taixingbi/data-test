plants need love, too. they don't harbor need water. there's something great about buying a plant, taking care of it and actually having it survived for more than a week or two. i put so much 11 to this plan. i watched its leaves, tried my hardest to keep it looking its best, and it's completely plastic. i feel like these last two years have been alive.
