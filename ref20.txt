Not surprisingly, the most popular months for weddings across the United States are September and October, with April through June just getting a decent amount of love. This being the case, getting married during these time frames can be very expensive. On top of that, guests and vendors may have other weddings trying to scoop them up, leading to scheduling headaches for brides, grooms and wedding planners alike.
